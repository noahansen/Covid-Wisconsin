    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>The purpose of our data analysis is to see how the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin
        is affected by different demographic and population factors in each county. Answering questions
        regarding how the spread of the disease is catalyzed throughout the state will be helpful in
        evaluating how policies can be altered or imposed in order to most effectively combat the spread of infection.
        Such analysis is useful for Wisconsin government and residents alike who have the power to implements or
        follow orders to keep one another safe.</p>
