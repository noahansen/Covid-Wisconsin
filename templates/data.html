    <h1>Data</h1>
    <p>We compiled multiple data sets into one cumulative csv file that maps all of the counties in Wisconsin to different
       statistics and information regarding Covid-19. This data set can be found in final.zip titled as 'final_data.csv'.
    </p>
    <h2>Final_Data Columns Explained</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Positive, Negative, Deaths </li>
        <p> Positive and negative add up to the total tests column, the amount of tests that either turned up positive or negative.
            Deaths is as it sounds, but is a subsection of the positive tests, and not it's own count.</p>
    </ul>
